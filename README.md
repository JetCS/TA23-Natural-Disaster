Introduction: The aim of this report is to give a general view of the initial thinking and design of iteration 1 for this group. In this report, the first part is the project overview with the problem statement, target audience and the potential sponsors. Followed by the current iteration containing the delivery plan for this iteration (epics, user stories and acceptance criteria). <br>

Background & Problem Statement: The three most frequent natural catastrophes in Australia are cyclones, floods, and wildfires. Natural disasters put wildlife, including plants and animals, especially at risk. The 2019â€“2020 bushfires in Australia affected an estimated 3 billion wild animals, including 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 181 million birds, 51 million amphibians, and innumerable plants and trees. Natural disasters lead to habitat loss, and the ecosystem suffers greatly as a result of the loss of wildlife habitats. It decreases biodiversity and is a major contributor to problems like global climate change that have an impact on human life. This study focuses on these issues because it is crucial to understand how natural disasters affect wildlife and how we may best assist them. This project is primarily aimed at teenagers and young adults aged between 15-25 who have a strong passion for wildlife. How might we raise awareness and provide more information about wildlife affected by natural disasters.<br>
